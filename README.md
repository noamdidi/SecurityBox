# SecurityBox

Network attacks scanner written in Python

## Description

SecurityBox is a service that provides you a full scan of your network. The scan mainly contains attacks checking, but devices scans as well.
The Server was written fully with Python, it contains the scripts for the attacks and devices, and communicationg with the client.
The Web interface was written in HTML and C# (.aspx files), it is responsible for providing user-friendly experience.
In this project, I've learned and used new network-related technologies in Python, as well as upgrading my skills in designing interfaces and server management (flow-control-wise).
